# Isolate Threat Actor(s) from Network Captures - (e.304) - isolate-threat-actor-from-network-capture

# Objectives

- Practice network packet capture analysis;
- Select and extract relevant information from one or more attack(s);
- Model and structure evidences to be encoded and distributed via MISP;
- Add contextualisation and information to transform the analysis into a complete readable story of the attack(s);

# Description

A [packet capture](./dataset) from the victim network was performed between the reverse proxy and the back-end systems.

- Analyse the pcap file to discover what happened;
- Extract evidences and model those evidences into a complete and descriptive MISP event;
