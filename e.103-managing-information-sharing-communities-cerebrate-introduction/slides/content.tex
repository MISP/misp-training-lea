\section{Being part of an information sharing community}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Joining an information sharing communities}
    Wide range of MISP communities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Private sector communities
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Private organisations, researchers, central hub
        \end{itemize}
        \item ISACs communities
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Central hub for sectorial or geographical Communities
            \item Examples: GSMA, FIRST.org, CSIRT Network, Banking, etc
        \end{itemize}
        \item Ad-hoc communities
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Often use for exercises such as ENISA or LockedShield
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Joining an information sharing communities}
    Considerations before joining a sharing community:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Understand the community's objectives
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Defense, prevention, collaboration, research, specific reporting duties
        \end{itemize}
        \item Make sure the use-cases are not conflicting
        \begin{itemize}
            \item False-positive appetite, maturity levels, topical interests
            \item Detection rules VS threat intelligence VS prevention
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Tips for being a good member of a sharing community}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As explained extensively in course \textit{e.206}, Context is king:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Taxonomies \& Galaxies
            \item MITRE ATT\&CK
            \item MISP Objects and relationships
            \item Sightings and \texttt{first\_seen} / \texttt{last\_seen}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Sharing results or reports
        \item Sharing enhancements or proposals to existing data
        \item Validating data (sightings) or flagging false positives
        \item Asking for support from the community
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Tips for building your own sharing community}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Different models for constituents
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\bf Having an account} on a MISP instance
            \item {\bf Hosting} their own instance and connecting to a peer
            \item {\bf Becoming member} of a sectorial MISP community that is connected to multiple peers
        \end{itemize}
        \item Planning ahead for future growth
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Estimating requirements (workforce, hardware requirements)
            \item Deciding early on common vocabularies (i.e. taxonomies)
            \item Offering services through MISP to promote adhesion
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Tips for building your own sharing community}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf Lead by example} - the power of immitation
        \item Don't block sharing with unrealistic quality controls
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You might loose organisations that might turn into valuable contributors
            \item Organisations will start sharing junk to stay above the thresholds
        \end{itemize}
        \item Encourage {\bf improving by doing}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What should the information look like?
            \item How should it be contextualised
            \item What do you consider as useful information?
            \item What tools did you use to get your conclusions?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Side effect is that you will end up {\bf raising the capabilities of your constituents}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Tips for building your own sharing community}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert the passive organisations into actively sharing ones
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Help them increase their capabilities
            \item Lead by example
            \item Give credit where credit is due
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Never steal the contribution of your community
            \end{itemize}
            \item Offers the possiblity to take over their data via delegation
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Anonymity of organisations might help them building confidence at the beginning
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Tips for building your own sharing community}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Encourage sharing of supporting materials, scripts or guidance
        \item Raise awareness about the benefits of a well modelled, graph based information sharing
        \item Again, context is king! If possible, make contextualisation a requirement
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Users can then filter based on their needs
            \item Classification help your peers to understand why it the data is important
            \item And also, why this data can be useful to them
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Dispelling the myths around blockers when it comes to information sharing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sharing difficulties are not really technical issues but often it's a matter of {\bf social interactions} (e.g. {\bf trust}).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You can play a role here: organise regular workshops, conferences, have face to face meetings
        \end{itemize}
        \item Legal restrictions
        \begin{itemize}
            \item "Our legal framework doesn't allow us to share information."
            \item "Risk of information leak is too high and it's too risky for our organization or partners."
        \end{itemize}
        \item Practical restrictions
        \begin{itemize}
            \item "We don't have information to share."
            \item "We don't have time to process or contribute indicators."
            \item "Our model of classification doesn't fit your model."
            \item "Tools for sharing information are tied to a specific format, we use a different one."
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Managing sub-sharing communities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Often within a community, smaller bubbles of information sharing will form
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Within a national private sector community, a dedicated community for financial institutions
            \item If an incident involves multiple organisations
        \end{itemize}
        \item MISP's sharing group serve this purpose mainly
        \item If you are building your own community, consider bootstraping these specific sharing community
        \item Organisations can self-organise, but you are probably the ones with the know-how to get them started
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Community management and orchestration tool}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Additional challenges of community management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MISP is just one part of the puzzle in any sharing community
        \item Information sharing presumes knowledge of contacts
        \item Creating reusable community-specific distribution list need to be maintained
        \item Fleet management for larger organisations needs additional work
        \item \textbf{Cerebrate} is the new open-source tool meant to address these challenges
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pictures/cerebrate-logo.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Motivations from a MISP perspective}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf Deficiencies} in our current tool chain
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Do I really have to jump through hoops and long e-mail chains to {\bf onboard new members}?
            \item How do I {\bf find trusted information} on who an organisation is in MISP?
            \item How can I {\bf manage a large cluster of MISPs} without tedious manual labour?
            \item If I run a community through MISP, how can I reuse my member information for other community tasks such as mailing lists?
            \item Information signing has been on the MISP roadmap for a long time - where do we get ground truths for a community from?
