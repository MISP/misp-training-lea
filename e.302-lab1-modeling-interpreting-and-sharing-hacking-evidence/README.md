# e.302: Labs I - Modelling, Interpreting and Sharing “Hacking Evidence”

## Objectives

- explore a dataset in search for information relevant for on-going investigations,
- understand how new information can shine new light on previous investigation cases,
- use AIL to bring insights and additional context for investigations,
- use MISP to correlate information and extend past events with new data,
- create intelligence by writing meaningful reports for other investigators to consume.

## Description

In this lab students cross information leaked from a ransomware gang with informatin stored in MISP to yields new insights on past cases.

Most of the work revolves around using AIL for exploring data, using some script to manipulate AIL API, and using MISP to model, share, and report new findings.

This lab provides two paths of progression depending on students' profile:

- a default progression where students have to run different scripts to acquire, ingest, and export data,
- a short progression skipping these steps to focus on using AIL's user interface, and MISP.

## Prerequisites
- for the default progression path, students must be proficient in using a unix shell, and editing files in a terminal.
- for the short progression path, there is no pre-requisite.
