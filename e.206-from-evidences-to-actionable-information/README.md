- How evidences can be useful for defense
- Why is contextualisation important and what options do we have in MISP
- Best practises to encode and contextualise
- How can context be leveraged

## Description

During investigation, many data points and evidences are collected and analysed. Improving contextualisation can leverage the use of the evidences. Those evidences can turn into meaningful and actionable for LEAs but also CSIRTs and SOCs. This module will show all the aspects of contextualisation with a practical example using the recent Conti (ransomware group) leak.
